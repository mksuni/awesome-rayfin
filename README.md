## What is Rayfin?

Project Rayfin is a modern **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** platform that helps teams build and ship applications faster. Define your data model with TypeScript decorators, and Rayfin handles the backend — auth, data API, storage, and hosting.

```bash
npm create @microsoft/rayfin@latest    # scaffold from an official template
npx rayfin up                          # deploy and run
```

## Using This Gallery

Point the Rayfin CLI at this repo to scaffold any template from the gallery:

```bash
npm create @microsoft/rayfin -- --template https://github.com/microsoft/awesome-rayfin
```

```bash
# OR from a local clone
npm create @microsoft/rayfin -- --template ./awesome-rayfin
```

The CLI reads `rayfin-template.yml` at the repo root and presents an interactive picker when multiple templates are available.

## Gallery Website

The repository includes a responsive gallery application generated from
`rayfin-template.yml` and the metadata in each template directory. It does not
maintain a separate hand-authored template catalog. The interface uses Microsoft
Fluent UI and supports persisted light and dark themes, defaulting to the
visitor's system preference. Each template includes a detail view with its
manifest-derived architecture and copyable Bash and PowerShell deployment flows
for provisioning a Fabric workspace and deploying with Rayfin.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run build` for a production build and `npm run preview` to inspect it
locally. The gallery is configured for Rayfin static hosting in
`rayfin/rayfin.yml`; deploy it with:

```bash
npm run rayfin:up
```

`npm run generate:gallery` refreshes the generated card data. The command also
runs automatically before development and production builds.

## 📦 Templates

| Template | Description | Auth | Data | Stack |
|----------|-------------|:----:|:----:|-------|
| **[Angular Blank App](./templates/angular-blankapp)** | Bare-bones Fabric-authenticated Angular + Material app — sign-in, routing, and a placeholder home page, with no data layer to remove | ✅ | ✅ | Angular, Material |
| **[Angular Dashboard App](./templates/angular-dashboard)** | Responsive Angular Material dashboard — top navbar + collapsible side menu, Project/Task data model, and optional one-click GitHub Issues/PRs sync for a public repo. | ✅ | ✅ | Angular, Material |

| **[Helsinki Public Transport](./templates/helsinki-public-transport)** | Live public transport over a Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Eventhouse - a DirectQuery semantic model queried straight from the browser, drawn on a 2D map and on a token-free 3D city twin built from open geodata | ✅ | — | React, Vite, Tailwind |
| **[IBCS Trainer](./templates/ibcs-trainer)** | HTML5 Canvas platformer that teaches IBCS chart rules level by level, embedded in a Fabric-authenticated Rayfin app; each play-through is persisted to a typed GameStats entity | ✅ | ✅ | React, Vite, Tailwind |
| **[Power BI Fixer](./templates/pbi-fixer)** | Fabric-authenticated workspace that inspects, documents, and fixes Power BI semantic models and reports — a best-practice analyzer with one-click and batch fixes, a report explorer with PBIR diffs, AI-assisted metadata cleanup, and a free IBCS visual, all powered server-side by Fabric User Data Functions | ✅ | — | React, Vite, Tailwind |
| **[Slide Deck](./templates/slide-deck)** | Interactive slide deck presenter with sessions, live slide tracking, and audience chat | ✅ | ✅ | React, Vite, Tailwind |
