"""Fetch the DOP20 orthophoto drape for the AOI core, via the LDBV WMS.

PLAN §7 phase 1 step 9 — the last terrain layer, and the one that makes the map photoreal rather
than cartographic.

⚠️ **This replaces the tile-download plan in §5.1, and the saving is large.** The plan assumed
DOP20 had to be pulled as 1 km GeoTIFF tiles — roughly 6 GB raw for this AOI — and mitigated that
with a streaming fetcher that downsampled and deleted each tile as it went. It turns out DOP20 is
not published as addressable tiles at all: the catalogue offers it by municipality, by district, or
as a **WMS**. A WMS is strictly better for a drape, because the request specifies the exact extent
*and the exact output resolution*. So instead of downloading 6 GB at 20 cm and throwing 97 % of it
away, this asks for the AOI once at the resolution the browser will actually use, and gets about
ten megabytes.

Resolution is a deliberate trade, not the source resolution:

  * 20 cm over a large core would be gigapixels, which no browser will hold and no GPU will sample.
  * The terrain mesh underneath is at 4 m posting. Detail far finer than that has nothing to sit
    on and only costs download.
  * The long side is capped so the browser can build a full mipmap chain for it — see the note in
    `main()`. This is a rendering limit, not a limit of the imagery.

The WMS caps a single request at 6500 px, so the mosaic is stitched from a few requests.

Output (public/terrain/<aoi-id>/):
  drape.jpg    the mosaic
