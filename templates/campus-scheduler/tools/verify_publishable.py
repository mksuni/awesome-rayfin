WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS SO BLUNT
--------------------------------------
`tools/check_release.mjs` answers "is the switch set correctly and does the disk agree?". It reads
a known list of paths. This answers the different and harder question: "is there anything in this
tree we do not know about?" — so it opens EVERY FILE AS BYTES.

⚠️ NO EXTENSION ALLOWLIST AND NO FOLDER SKIPPING BEYOND THE FOUR DECLARED BELOW, both of which it
prints. Narrower versions of this idea have passed in this codebase's history while the withheld
name was still on screen: a `.json`-only scan misses a `.bin` sidecar and a compiled bundle; a
"source files only" scan misses generated assets, and generated assets are exactly where a name
re-enters after someone fixes the generator's output instead of the generator. GLSL is a string
inside the bundle, so shader comments ship too.

TWO CHECKS, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT IN KIND
------------------------------------------
1. DATA — paths and content stamps that ARE the restricted material. Any hit is a hard failure and
   there is no allowlist, because nothing here is ever acceptable in a published tree.

2. NAMES — a byte census for the words, judged against a PATH allowlist with a reason for each
   entry. This one must not be a hard "the word must not appear": under
   `release.json navigatumData: "synthetic"` the TUM campus deliberately still ships, so its name
   is all over the source, the configs and the tests, and a scan that failed on the word would
   have to be switched off — which is how a check becomes decoration. What it catches instead is a
   NEW file carrying the name that nobody has looked at. That is the realistic leak.

⚠️ AN EMPTY SCAN MUST NEVER REPORT SUCCESS. If the walk finds no files at all — a mistyped
`--root`, a folder that does not exist — this exits non-zero. A rewrite of a sibling script once
examined nothing and said so approvingly.

    ⚠️ THE GUARD USED TO BE THE ONLY FILE IN THE REPOSITORY THAT NAMED THESE PEOPLE.

    The first version was a plain alternation of the two surnames, with an allowlist entry excusing
    this file, reason: "has to spell the names out to find them". Every word of that was true and
    the conclusion was still wrong — the check reported `0 not covered` while publishing, to a
    public gallery, two real surnames of staff at a university this repository names elsewhere.
    A guard that leaks the thing it guards has not reduced the exposure, it has relocated it.

    (Writing this docstring proved the point: quoting that old line as an example put one of the
    names straight back, and this check failed on its own file until the quote came out.)

    It does not have to spell them out. Comparing salted digests answers exactly the same
    question, and a digest cannot be read back into a name. The allowlist entry is gone with the
    literals, so this file is now scanned like any other and CAN fail — which is the point.

    ⚠️ THE DIGESTS ARE NOT A SECRET EITHER, and must never be treated as one. The keyspace of
    German surnames is small enough to enumerate, so this defeats a reader, not an attacker. It is
    the right tool because the risk here IS a reader: someone scrolling a public template and
    finding a name. Do not reach for this to hide anything that would matter to an attacker.

    ⚠️ THE ARRANGEMENT, NOT THE DATA. Every other class asks "is restricted CONTENT in here?".
    This one asks the question all of them missed: "does this tree describe a confidential
    RELATIONSHIP?" Several files described an export being handed over and the terms it came
    under. None carried a single restricted row. The data was perfectly withheld and the tree
    published the engagement instead — which is the part a counterparty minds, and the part that
    survives the data being gone.

    It is about phrasing, not names: this repository names eight universities on purpose. What is
    not allowed is describing what passed between us and one of them.

    ⚠️ A CONJUNCTION IN A WINDOW, AFTER TWO VERSIONS THAT EACH FAILED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
    The first knew only "sent us" and missed "<institution> sent", which was the dominant form
    here — five instances survived the pass meant to remove them, because the pattern was written
    from the sentences just fixed rather than from the shape of the claim. Widening it to any
    actor-plus-verb then flagged five innocent lines: "they must stay shared" about shader
    uniforms, "a first version gave every...", "the same answer OTH gave before its floor plans
    were OCR'd". Neither state is usable: one misses leaks, the other gets silenced.

    So a claim needs all three parts near each other, in any order and across line breaks: someone
    who could hand data over, a verb for handing it over, and something that is data. "The same
    answer OTH gave" has two of the three and is correctly ignored. Explicit terms bypass the
    conjunction, because "under NDA" needs no subject to be a disclosure.
