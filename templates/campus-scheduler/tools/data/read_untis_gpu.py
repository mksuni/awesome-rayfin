"""Read a real Untis export into this project's dataset tables.

Turns the GPU files a university's scheduling system produces into `data/oth-real/*.json` with the
same shape the generated datasets use, so the app, the solver and the twin can read a real
timetable without any of them learning a new format.

    python tools/data/read_untis_gpu.py                  # build data/oth-real
    python tools/data/read_untis_gpu.py --report         # what it could not map, and why

Input (`04. Customer/01. EDU/OTH Regensburg/KI Hackathon/`):

  Untis-Export/Fak.{SG,IM,EI}.TXT, Fak BM.TXT   GPU001 — Stundenplan, one row per CLASS and period
  Untis-Export/BM - Vorlesungen.TXT             GPU002 — Unterricht, the lessons behind the grid
  Untis-Export/BM - Zeitwünsche.TXT             GPU016 — Zeitwünsche (lecturer time preferences)
  StVP-Excel/Winter2627-StVP-*.xlsx             the per-professor Stundenverteilungsplan

⚠️ THE GPU NUMBERS ABOVE WERE WRONG IN THIS FILE UNTIL 2026-08-06, and they are the vocabulary we
share with the customer's Untis admin. The grid was labelled GPU002, the lessons GPU001 — exactly
swapped — and the Zeitwünsche GPU005, which is the ROOM export. Checked against the Untis manual
(`ti_allgemeine-schnittstellen.htm`) and against the files themselves: `Fak BM.TXT` row 1 is
`1,"BM3a","Leha","BW_LOP","S051",4,6` — class, teacher, subject, room, day, period, i.e. a
timetable (GPU001); `BM - Vorlesungen.TXT` carries Wochenwert and a date range, i.e. lesson master
data (GPU002); `BM - Zeitwünsche.TXT` is `"L","Wob",1,1,-3`, element/day/period/weight (GPU016).
Nothing parsed differently — every reader here matches on CONTENT — but asking OTH to re-send
"GPU005" would have got us their room list.

⚠️ ENCODINGS DIFFER INSIDE ONE EXPORT — four files are cp1252 and the Zeitwünsche file is UTF-8.
Read per file or the umlauts mojibake silently (§25.1).

⚠️ ONE ROW PER CLASS, NOT PER LESSON. 606 of 1 200 Unterrichtsnummern carry more than one class, so
a lecture shared by four cohorts appears four times. Collapsing on `Unterrichtsnummer` is what
turns those back into one session with several attendees — and skipping that step reports a
four-cohort lecture as four room conflicts.

⚠️ WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS OURS. Sessions, times, rooms, classes, subjects and the
Zeitwünsche are OTH's. Room capacity, room type, class head counts and any lecturer's full name are
NOT in the export (§25.5) and must never be invented into these tables — `provenance.json` records
that, and the app hides what it cannot support.
