"""Where the Fabric items live — read from the environment, never from a literal.

⚠️ THESE USED TO BE FOUR COPIES OF ONE TENANT'S GUIDS, WRITTEN INTO THE SOURCE.

That is fine in a private repository and wrong in a template: a clone would carry a workspace id
and a lakehouse id belonging to somebody else's Fabric capacity, and the scripts would either fail
with an authorisation error that reads as a broken tool, or — for anyone who happened to have
access — write into the wrong workspace.

None of these values is a secret. A workspace id is useless without permission on it. The reason
they do not belong here is simply that they are one deployment's coordinates, and a template has
no deployment.

Set them once per shell:

    $env:FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID = "<workspace guid>"
    $env:FABRIC_LAKEHOUSE_ID = "<lakehouse guid>"     # after setup_lakehouse.py has created it
    $env:FABRIC_FOLDER_ID    = "<folder guid>"        # optional; omit to create at the root
    $env:FABRIC_SQL_SERVER   = "<host>.database.fabric.microsoft.com,1433"
    $env:FABRIC_SQL_DATABASE = "<database name, which carries the database guid as a suffix>"

⚠️ A MISSING VALUE RAISES, IT DOES NOT DEFAULT. A default that "usually works" is how a script
that writes Delta tables ends up writing them somewhere nobody meant, and the write succeeds.

    the endpoint still demands an AAD token — but it points every clone of this repository at one
    tenant's database, which is not a place a template should know about.
