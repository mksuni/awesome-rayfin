"""Load the whole timetable into dbo.PlanAssignments, so no assignment lives only in the app.

WHY A TOOL AND NOT THE APP. The requirement is that every assignment is queryable in SQL. The app
upserts a session when a planner MOVES it, which covers the rows that are not reproducible from
anything else — but a reader querying the table would still see only the edits. The other ~1 965
rows are the baked baseline, and something has to put them there once.

WHY TDS AND NOT THE DATA LAYER. Rayfin's data-plane endpoint wants a Rayfin session, which exists
only inside the hosted app: it rejects the publishable key alone and rejects a Power BI token. So
this connects to the Fabric SQL database directly with an AAD token, the same way the table itself
was verified.

⚠️ THE ID MUST MATCH `assignmentId()` IN `src/api/planStore.ts`, BYTE FOR BYTE. Both writers key a
row on site + sessionId, and if the two disagree by so much as a nibble the app's upsert misses the
seeded row and INSERTS A SECOND ONE — leaving two rows claiming to be the current position of the
same session, which is precisely the failure this table exists to prevent. The algorithm is
reimplemented here rather than approximated, and `--verify-ids` checks a sample against values
computed by the TypeScript so the duplication cannot drift silently.
