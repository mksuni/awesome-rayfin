"""Prove `dbo.PlanAssignments` still matches the plan the app serves.

A GATE, not a report: it exits non-zero, so it can be run after any dataset regeneration and before
a demo. Companion to `verify_model_agreement.py`, which does the same job for the semantic model.

⚠️ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE TABLE WENT WRONG SILENTLY. `seed_plan_assignments.py` used to MERGE and
never delete, so regenerating the timetable — which changes how cohorts are split, and therefore the
sessionIds — left 911 rows describing sessions that no longer existed. Nothing looked broken: each
orphan named a real course in a real room at a real hour, and SQL has no way to know the app stopped
producing it. The only way to see it is to recompute what the datasets say and compare.

Three failure modes are reported separately, because they have different causes:

  orphans  rows the current datasets do not produce   (a prune did not run)
  missing  assignments with no row at all             (a seed did not run)
  drifted  rows whose slot or room disagree           (a seed ran against older data)
