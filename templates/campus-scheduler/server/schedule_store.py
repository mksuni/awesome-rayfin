"""The planning dataset, in memory, with the lookups the tools actually ask for.

Loaded once at start-up. The whole dataset is ~1 000 sessions and ~1 000 rooms — small enough
that every question a planner asks can be answered from RAM in microseconds, which is the
difference between a conversation and a progress bar.

⚠️ THE DATA IS NOT ALWAYS SYNTHETIC, AND THIS MODULE USED TO SAY IT ALWAYS WAS. OTH's and
LMU's timetables are generated (see the dataset's provenance.json) because neither university
publishes one. TUM Garching does: its 1 470 sessions are REAL bookings from TUMonline, and its
published plan is the plan TUM actually runs. Only the lecturers and cohorts there are invented,
because the feed carries neither. Read `provenance.json` rather than assuming.

⚠️ The GEOGRAPHY is real everywhere: rooms sit in real university buildings at real coordinates,
and where a building's interior was actually surveyed the room outlines are the surveyed ones —
Gebäude K's ground floor at OTH, all three levels of Oettingenstraße 67 at LMU, and the whole
55xx block at Garching. Anything this module reports about *where* something is, is true.

⚠️ **THE SITE IS NOW A PARAMETER, NOT A PROCESS-WIDE CONSTANT** (PLAN §21.1). It used to be read
from `SCHEDULER_SITE` at import, so one container served exactly one university and `SITE`, `DATA`,
`SITE_LABEL` were module-level. That was a deliberate decision, and its stated reason — "making the
site a per-request parameter would mean holding every dataset and threading the choice through the
solver for no benefit anyone has asked for" — was correct until the benefit was asked for: one twin
of German higher education rather than four separate deployments.

What that decision bought, and what replaces it:

* **Memory.** Every dataset is now resident. ~1 000 sessions and 1 000–9 300 rooms per site, loaded
  lazily per site and cached, so a container that is only ever asked about one university still
  holds only that one.
* **Wrong-university answers.** Every tool already takes `store` as its first argument, so the seam
  existed; nothing closes over a module default any more. `SCHEDULER_SITE` survives as the DEFAULT
  for a request that does not name a site, which keeps existing deployments byte-identical in
  behaviour.
* **Access control.** One container per university used to BE the isolation. It no longer is, and
  application-level scoping is a downgrade unless it is tested — see PLAN §21.1 and §17.3.
